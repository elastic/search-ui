# Elastic Search UI

A [React](https://reactjs.org) library that allows you to quickly implement search experiences without re-inventing the wheel.

Check out our [full documentation site](https://docs.elastic.co/search-ui) which contains detailed documentation for setting up and using Search UI in your products.

## Running Locally

### Node

We depend upon the version of node defined in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).

You will probably want to install a node version manager. [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended.

To install and use the correct node version with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install
```

Install dependencies with yarn:
```
yarn
```

### Sandbox
  
A [sandbox application](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/master/examples/sandbox/README.md) is available to demo usage and act as a development aid.
  
To run it locally at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

```bash
yarn build
cd examples/sandbox
yarn start
```
  
Additional development tips are available in the [Search UI Contributor's Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
