## Getting started üê£

Search UI supports any search engine provider and JavaScript framework.

It is developed and maintained by [Elastic](https://elastic.co).

You can use Search UI to quickly build robust, enjoyable, fully-featured search experiences.

To begin, choose your framework:

- [React](packages/react-search-ui/README.md)
- More coming! [Contributions](#contribute-) welcome.

_Note: The Search UI is in beta. We do not recommend production use._

## Developing Search UI

### Requirements

Node: 8.10
NPM: 6.4

### Mono-repo explanation

This repository is maintained as a Monorepo using [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

Lerna configuration is contained in `lerna.json`.

`/packages` - Contains publishable search-ui npm packages.
`/examples` - Contains non-publishable examples of search-ui usage. They are declared
as "packages" in `lerna.json` so that `npx lerna bootstrap` will automatically wire up the
examples to local dependencies.

Because all examples are declared as "private", when running lerna commands other than bootstrap, (like `publish` and
`test`), the `--no-private` flag should be appended.

Dependencies are declared in a package.json hierarchy.

- / package.json - Dependencies for repo tooling, like `husky` and `lerna`.
- /packages package.json - Common dev dependencies for all Search UI npm packages. Any dev Common dev dependencies for al that does not need to be called directly in a package level npm command
  can be declared here.
- /packages/{package_name} package.json - Package specific dependencies.

Note that we do not encourage "hoisting" dependencies through lerna. This WILL
cause the examples applications to error out from dependency version conflicts.

### Installing dependencies

From the root level of this repository, run the following commands in order:

```shell
# Install top level depenedencies at the root of the project
npm install

# Install dependencies in the /packages directory
(cd packages && npm install)

# Install all dependencies for the individual packages
npm run bootstrap
```

### Building

All packages:

```shell
# from project root
npm run build
```

Single package:

```shell
# from inside a package
npm run build
```

### Testing

All packages:

```shell
# from project root
npm run test
```

Single package:

```shell
# from inside a package
npm run test
```

### Sandbox

The [sandbox](examples/sandbox/README.md) app can be used as a local development
aid.

## Using

### Publishing

```
# Check which files have been changed, verify that
# the packages you expect to be changed are listed.
npm run changed

git checkout -b "release-0.2.1"

# Manually update CHANGELOG files for updated repositories and commit them.

# Creates a new local commit with updated package.json files and tags. It's important
that you do not rewrite history after this release commit has been created.
npx lerna version 0.2.1 --no-push

git push --tags

# Go through PR approval and rebase+merge to master. Do not create a merge commit, it will throw off the `lerna changed` command

git checkout master
git pull

# Then finally, publish
npm run publish
```
