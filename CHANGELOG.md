## 0.9.0 (June 4, 2019)

- Updated Facet component to support quick search filter options (@m-sureshraj in #248)
- Performance fixes (@JasonStoltz in #249)

### Breaking Changes

The performance fixes PR introduced significant changes to the Search UI API.

- Search UI now has a peer dependency on react 16.8, bumped from 16.6.
- **`SearchProvider` no longer accepts a function as a child.** This will affect
  EVERY Search UI implementation. If you were previously accessing State or Actions
  in that render prop, you will now need to instead use the `WithSearch` component.

  ex.

  Before:

  ```
  <SearchProvider config={config}>
    {({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => {
      ...
    }}
  </SearchProvider>
  ```

  After:

  ```
  <SearchProvider config={config}>
    <WithSearch
        mapContextToProps={({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => ({
          searchTerm,
          setSearchTerm,
          results
        })}
      >
      {({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => {
        ...
      }}
    </WithSearch>
  </SearchProvider>
  ```

- The API for `withSearch` has changed. You now must specify which actions and state you need in a
  mapContextToProps function.

Before:

```
export default withSearch(ResultsContainer);
```

After:

```
export default withSearch(({ results }) => ({ results }))(ResultsContainer);
```

- All components in this library, and components created with `withSearch` are now
  "Pure Components". It is possible that if you were mutating state incorrectly with `setState`, that the components
  no longer update. See this guide for more information: https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#examples.
- `SearchConsumer` was renamed to `WithSearch` and now requires a `mapContextToProps` parameter.

Before:

```
<SearchConsumer>
  {({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => {
    ...
  }}
</SearchConsumer>
```

After:

```
<WithSearch
    mapContextToProps={({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => ({
      searchTerm,
      setSearchTerm,
      results
    })}
  >
  {({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm, results }) => {
    ...
  }}
</WithSearch>
```

## 0.8.0 (May 2, 2019)

- Configurable `ResultsPerPage` component options (@m-sureshraj in #224)
- Connector-less usage (@JasonStoltz in #225)
- Swapped autocomplete and autosuggest ordering in Autocomplete (@JasonStoltz in #222)
- Added cursor pointer to facet checkbox on hover (@JasonStoltz in #221)
- Containers no longer hide themselves by default before first search (@byronhulcher in #203)
- Fix warning message about importing browserHistory (@byronhulcher in #215)

### Breaking Changes

- Connector-less usage introduces breaking changes for the **Connector layer**. This would impact anyone who has
  implemented any sort of Connector directly (#225). The following interface methods have been renamed:
  - `click` -> `onResultClick`
  - `autocompleteClick` -> `onAutocompleteResultClick`
  - `search` -> `onSearch`
  - `autocomplete` -> `onAutocomplete`
- The ordering of "autocompleteResults" and "autocompleteSuggestions" has been swapped in the default view of
  `Autocomplete`. If you are using the default view these will be visibly different (#222).
- Some components will no longer automatically hide themselves until search results are rendered (#203). This means
  you may need to manually hide them using the `wasSearched` property from state in order to maintain this behavior.
  This affects the following components:
  - `PagingInfo`
  - `Sorting`
  - `ResultsPerPage`

## 0.7.0 (April 19, 2019)

- All components now accept a `className` property #56
- SearchBox `inputProps` now accepts a `className` property #191
- Facet components now accept a `filterType` prop of "all", "or", or "none" #53 #10
- Filter related actions now accept a `filterType of "all", "or", or "none" #53 #10

## 0.6.1 (April 17, 2019)

- Fixed `autocompleteView` prop in `SearchBox`

## 0.6.0 (April 16, 2019)

- Added autocomplete support to Search UI #113
  - The SearchBox component now has many additional configuration options available for using Autocomplete
  - Autocomplete queries can now be configured much like a the main search query via configuration on the SearchDriver / SearchProvider.
- `SearchBox` view now uses Downshift library #135
- The `Result` view component signature changed in order to accept primarily just a single `results` #82
- Query configuration options were moved out of the main configuration in SearchDriver / SearchProvider and are now nested under a `searchQuery` field. Described in Autocomplete Spec: #113, commit 902b431338ece6c5b759f35af2688f85638663b0
- The `searchQuery` allows adding static configuration to search queries, like `filters`, etc., which are applied to queries regardless statically, and not from application state. Describe in Autocomplete spec: #113, commit: 121616c4d6647a9f4bc059869d620c083e0b90eb
- Fixed a number of issues that were occurring when using custom views: #160
- Added a debug option to SearchDriver #169
- Fixed unmount / history issues when using client side routing: #174 #177 #178

## 0.5.3 (April 10, 2019)

- Fixed inter-package dependencies so they are fixed to current version.
- Reverted breaking change introduced in version 0.5.2, which moved
  certain configuration in the SearchDriver to a 'queryConfig' property.

## 0.5.1 (March 7, 2019)

Fixed this error: "ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined"

## 0.5.0 (March 6, 2019)

- #90
- #8
- #15
- #107
- #114

Breaking Changes:

- Generally speaking the data model changed, especially with regards to `filters`, `facets`
  and `results`. If you were working directly with any of these types of state
  you will likely need to rework your solution. The data model can be seen
  here: https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/8ddad47165d17c768a024a134059f215f9096365/packages/react-search-ui/src/types.

## 0.4.0 (February 11, 2019)

- Search As You Type support via a `searchAsYouType` option on `SearchBox`.

## 0.2.0 (January 25, 2019)

- Updated to `search-ui` v0.2.0, which reworked how query filters are maintained
  in the URL. Old search results links that have been saved will be incompatible
  with this new version.
- Updated type schema of `ValueFilterValue`.

## 0.1.0 (January 3, 2019)

- Initial "Alpha" Release
