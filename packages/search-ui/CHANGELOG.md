Breaking Changes:

- Generally speaking the data model changed, especially with regards to `filters`, `facets`
  and `results`. If you were working directly with any of these types of state
  you will likely need to rework your solution. The data model can be seen
  here: https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/8ddad47165d17c768a024a134059f215f9096365/packages/react-search-ui/src/types.
- Connectors have a completely different interface. They now accept state
  directly and return state, rather than App Search syntax. If you had
  created a custom connector, you will need to rework your solution. More details
  on this are documented in the "Creating your own Connector" section of
  the README.

## 0.5.1 (March 7, 2019)

Fixed this error: "ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined"

## 0.5.3 (April 10, 2019)

- Reverted breaking change introduced in version 0.5.2, which moved
  certain configuration in the SearchDriver to a 'queryConfig' property.
