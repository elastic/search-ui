Input element which accepts search terms and triggers a new search query.

### Example

```jsx

import { SearchBox } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

...

<SearchBox />
```

### Configuring search queries

The input from `SearchBox` will be used to trigger a new search query. That query can be further customized
in the `SearchProvider` configuration, using the `searchQuery` property. See the <DocLink
  id="api-core-configuration"
  section="search-query-queryconfig"
  text="Search Query Configuration"
/> guide for more information.

### Example of passing custom props to text input element

```jsx
<SearchBox inputProps={{ placeholder: "custom placeholder" }} />
```

### Example of view customizations

You can customize the entire view. This is useful to use an entirely different
autocomplete library (we use [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift)). But for making small
customizations, like simply hiding the search button, this is often overkill.

```jsx
<SearchBox
  view={({ onChange, value, onSubmit }) => (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <input value={value} onChange={(e) => onChange(e.currentTarget.value)} />
    </form>
  )}
/>
```

You can also just customize the input section of the search box. Useful for things
like hiding the submit button or rearranging dom structure:

```jsx
<SearchBox
  inputView={({ getAutocomplete, getInputProps, getButtonProps }) => (
    <>
      <div className="sui-search-box__wrapper">
        <input
          {...getInputProps({
            placeholder: "I am a custom placeholder"
          })}
        />
        {getAutocomplete()}
      </div>
      <input
        {...getButtonProps({
          "data-custom-attr": "some value"
        })}
      />
    </>
  )}
/>
```

Note that `getInputProps` and `getButtonProps` are
[prop getters](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters).
They are meant return a props object to spread over their corresponding UI elements. This lets you arrange
elements however you'd like in the DOM. It also lets you pass additional properties. You should pass properties
through these functions, rather directly on elements, in order to not override base values. For instance,
adding a `className` through these functions will assure that the className is only appended, not overriding base class values on those values.

`getAutocomplete` is used to determine where the autocomplete dropdown will be shown.

Or you can also just customize the autocomplete dropdown:

```jsx
<SearchBox
  autocompleteView={({ autocompletedResults, getItemProps }) => (
    <div className="sui-search-box__autocomplete-container">
      {autocompletedResults.map((result, i) => (
        <div
          {...getItemProps({
            key: result.id.raw,
            item: result
          })}
        >
          Result {i}: {result.title.snippet}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

### Example using autocomplete results

"Results" are search results. The default behavior for autocomplete
results is to link the user directly to a result when selected, which is why
a "titleField" and "urlField" are required for the default view.

```jsx
<SearchBox
  autocompleteResults={{
    titleField: "title",
    urlField: "nps_link"
  }}
/>
```

### Example using autocomplete suggestions

"Suggestions" are different than "results". Suggestions are suggested queries. Unlike an autocomplete result, a
suggestion does not go straight to a result page when selected. It acts as a regular search query and
refreshes the result set.

```jsx
<SearchBox autocompleteSuggestions={true} />
```

### Example using autocomplete suggestions and autocomplete results

The default view will show both results and suggestions, divided into
sections. Section titles can be added to help distinguish between the two.

```jsx
<SearchBox
  autocompleteResults={{
    sectionTitle: "Suggested Results",
    titleField: "title",
    urlField: "nps_link"
  }}
  autocompleteSuggestions={{
    sectionTitle: "Suggested Queries"
  }}
/>
```

### Example retrieving suggestions from another index

<DocCallOut
  color="warning"
  title="Supported only by the Elasticsearch-connector"
/>

A different index can be used for the suggestions. Some examples:

- Popular queries index from analytics
- Brands index from product data
- Categories index from product data

Below we are using the `popular_queries` index and performing a prefix match search on the `query.suggest` field. One thing to note, make sure the api-key has access to the index.

````jsx

#### Autocomplete Configuration

```js
autocompleteQuery: {
  suggestions: {
    types: {
      popularQueries: {
        search_fields: {
          "query.suggest": {} // fields used to query
        },
        result_fields: {
          query: { // fields used for display
            raw: {}
          }
        },
        index: "popular_queries",
        queryType: "results"
      }
    },
    size: 4
  }
}

````

#### Component Configuration

```jsx
<SearchBox
  autocompleteSuggestions={{
    popularQueries: {
      queryType: "results",
      displayField: "query" // specify which field used to display the suggestion
    },
    }
  }}
/>
```

You also have the option to customise the `view` of the autocomplete to show more fields.

### Configuring autocomplete queries

Autocomplete queries can be customized in the `SearchProvider` configuration, using the `autocompleteQuery` property.
See the <DocLink id="api-core-configuration" section="Autocomplete Query" text="Autocomplete Query Configuration" /> for more information.

```jsx
<SearchProvider
    config={{
      ...
      autocompleteQuery: {
        // Customize the query for autocompleteResults
        results: {
          result_fields: {
            // Add snippet highlighting
            title: { snippet: { size: 100, fallback: true } },
            nps_link: { raw: {} }
          }
        },
        // Customize the query for autocompleteSuggestions
        suggestions: {
          types: {
            // Limit query to only suggest based on "title" field
            documents: { fields: ["title"] }
          },
          // Limit the number of suggestions returned from the server
          size: 4
        }
      }
    }}
>
    <SearchBox
      autocompleteResults={{
        sectionTitle: "Suggested Results",
        titleField: "title",
        urlField: "nps_link"
      }}
      autocompleteSuggestions={{
        sectionTitle: "Suggested Queries",
      }}
    />
</SearchProvider>
```

### Example using multiple types of autocomplete suggestions

"Suggestions" can be generated via multiple methods. They can be derived from
common terms and phrases inside of documents, or be "popular" queries
generated from actual search queries made by users. This will differ
depending on the particular Search API you are using.

**Note**: Elastic App Search currently only supports type "documents", and Elastic Site Search and Workplace Search
do not support suggestions. This is purely illustrative in case a Connector is used that
does support multiple types.

```jsx
<SearchProvider
    config={{
      ...
      autocompleteQuery: {
        suggestions: {
          types: {
            documents: { },
            // FYI, this is not a supported suggestion type in any current connector, it's an example only
            popular_queries: { }
          }
        }
      }
    }}
>
    <SearchBox
      autocompleteSuggestions={{
        // Types used here need to match types requested from the server
        documents: {
          sectionTitle: "Suggested Queries",
        },
        popular_queries: {
          sectionTitle: "Popular Queries"
        }
      }}
    />
</SearchProvider>
```

### Example using autocomplete in a site header

This is an example from a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site, which overrides "submit" to navigate a user to the search
page for suggestions, and maintaining the default behavior when selecting a result.

```jsx
<SearchBox
  autocompleteResults={{
    titleField: "title",
    urlField: "nps_link"
  }}
  autocompleteSuggestions={true}
  onSubmit={(searchTerm) => {
    navigate("/search?q=" + searchTerm);
  }}
  onSelectAutocomplete={(selection, {}, defaultOnSelectAutocomplete) => {
    if (selection.suggestion) {
      navigate("/search?q=" + selection.suggestion);
    } else {
      defaultOnSelectAutocomplete(selection);
    }
  }}
/>
```

| inputProps                    | Props for underlying 'input' element. I.e., `{ placeholder: "Enter Text"}`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| searchAsYouType               | Executes a new search query with every key stroke. You can fine tune the number of queries made by adjusting the `debounceLength` parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| debounceLength                | When using `searchAsYouType`, it can be useful to "debounce" search requests to avoid creating an excessive number of requests. This controls the length to debounce / wait.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| autocompleteSuggestions       | Configure and autocomplete query suggestions. Boolean option is primarily available for implementing custom views. Configuration may or may not be keyed by "Suggestion Type", as APIs for suggestions may support may than 1 type of suggestion. If it is not keyed by Suggestion Type, then the configuration will be applied to the first type available. |
| autocompleteMinimumCharacters | Minimum number of characters before autocompleting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| onSelectAutocomplete          | Allows overriding behavior when selected, to avoid creating an entirely new view. In addition to the current `selection`, various helpers are passed as `options` to the second parameter. This third parameter is the default `onSelectAutocomplete`, which allows you to defer to the original behavior.                                                   |
| onSubmit                      | Allows overriding behavior when submitted.

### View customization

A complete guide to view customization can be found in the <DocLink id="guides-customizing-styles-and-html" section="customizing-html" text="Customization: Component views and HTML" /> section.

If you plan to use this component with only slight customization for style, we recommend that you _only_ attempt to use the `inputView` and `autocompleteView` props for customization. Replicating the entire SearchBox
view via the `view` prop is extremely difficult.

Note that while our SearchBox view component is quite complicated, a search box can be very basic. The following is a custom view that simply accepts user input and executes a new search query:

```jsx
<SearchBox
  view={({ value, onChange, onSubmit }) => (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      <input type="submit" value="Search" />
    </form>
  )}
/>
```

The following properties are available to the `view` prop:

### Input view customization

If you just care to customize the look and feel of the input box, you can use the `inputView` prop. The following properties will be passed to the view your provide.

Note that the underlying SearchBox view uses the [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/downshift#props-used-in-examples) library. Many of the props that are passed to this view are common to, and actually generated from, the Downshift library.
