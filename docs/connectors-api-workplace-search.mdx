<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Technical preview">
Workplace Search connector for Search UI is currently in technical preview status. It is not ready for production use.
</DocCallOut>

This Connector is used to connect Search UI to Elastic's [Workplace Search](https://www.elastic.co/workplace-search/) API.

## Usage

```shell
npm install --save @elastic/search-ui-workplace-search-connector
```

```js
import WorkplaceSearchAPIConnector from "@elastic/search-ui-workplace-search-connector";

const connector = new WorkplaceSearchAPIConnector({
  kibanaBase: "https://search-ui-sandbox.kb.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243",
  enterpriseSearchBase: "https://search-ui-sandbox.ent.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io",
  redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000",
  clientId: "8e495e40fc4e6acf515e557e634de39d4f727f7f60a3afed24a99ce316607c1e"
});
```

See the [usage example](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/master/examples/sandbox/src/pages/workplace-search/index.js) in our sandbox app. The example uses a private Elastic Cloud deployment. Make sure to update the configuration values to use with your own [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/) deployment.

## Authentication

The Workplace Search API requires authentication. This connector uses OAuth authentication. You can read more about that [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/current/building-custom-search-workplace-search.html) and [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/current/workplace-search-search-oauth.html).

Using this connector will populate two additional pieces of Application State:

`isLoggedIn` (boolean) - This can be used to determine whether or not a user is authenticated. Requests using this connector will only work if a user is authenticatied. If this is false, consider showing a "Login" link using the `authorizeUrl` state.

`authorizeUrl` (string) - This can be used to create a "Login" link for users to initiate OAuth authentication.

`logout` - (function) - This action can be used to log out user out of the search experience. Under the hood it 1) deletes the saved token from LocalStorage and 2) logs user out of Enterprise Search and Kibana to prevent the ability to get a new access token.
