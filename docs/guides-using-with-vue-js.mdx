While Search UI doesn't have a component library for Vue.js, you can still use them together, just with a little extra work.

To achieve that you'll need to import and work directly with Search UI Core API. Read a short <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/architecture" /> guide for high-level overview on the approach.

Once you're familiar with the concept of Search UI core, the following docs will give you deeper dive into available APIs:

- <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/core/configuration" />
- <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/core/state" />
- <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/core/actions" />

## Example

The following demo is a good starting point for your Search UI implementation. The source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/examples/vue
