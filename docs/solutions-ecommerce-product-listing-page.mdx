### Applying Filters to the Product Listing Page

It's important to consider SEO of a category page. Some of your customers will come from search engines and having a good-looking URL will help you rank higher.

Let's say we want to have a category page for TVs. It can be done by taking a general search page and applying a filter to only show TVs.

Now, if we do so on a search page, we'll have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/search?filters%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=categories&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=TVs
```

Not very readable!

What we want instead is to have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/category/tvs/
```

To achieve that, we'll need to:

1. Create the category page in our application;
1. Apply a filter via Search UI config.

The first part is highly dependent on your application's framework. Refer to its documentation for creating a new page.

For the second part, take the Search UI config you're using on the search page and add the `searchQuery.filters` value. Then pass the new config to your `SearchProvider`:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { config } from "./config";
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const categoryTvsConfig = {
  ...config,
  searchQuery: {
    ...config.searchQuery,
    // adding a filter to only show TVs
    filters: [{ field: "parent_category", values: ["TVs"] }]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPageTvs() {
  return (
    // Pass the new config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={categoryTvsConfig}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          // The components you want to render go here
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! Now the new category page will have a good URL and will only show the results that match the filter.

### facets

- On sale Facet (Out the box toggle)
- Conditional Facet

### Variant Examples

https://baymard.com/blog/combine-variations-one-list-item

- products appearing multiple times, one for each variant
- collapse the products on the productId. Each product can contain one or more variants. display variants within the product
- pros vs cons of variants within app-search

### Sorting

Adding sorting is simple â€” just use our `<Sorting/>` component, like so:

```js
import { Sorting } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

<Sorting
  label={"Sort by"}
  sortOptions={[
    {
      name: "Relevance",
      value: []
    },
    {
      name: "Price: Low to High",
      value: [{ field: "price", direction: "asc" }]
    },
    {
      name: "Price: High to Low",
      value: [{ field: "price", direction: "desc" }]
    }
  ]}
/>;
```

A good starting point for sorting options is to have these three:

- Relevance / Featured / Best Match (usually the default option)
- Price: Low to High
- Price: High to Low

Also consider adding some of these, although they might not be applicable to your data:

- Popularity
- User rating
- Distance (to user)
- Newest first

### Handling no results

Talk about when theres no results for the category listing. For example:

- the brand category is empty, recommend other brands to the user that is linked to the brand
- The sale has closed, recommend the category to the user that isn't on sale

```

```
