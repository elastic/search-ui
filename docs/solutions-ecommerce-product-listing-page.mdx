### Applying Filters to the Product Listing Page

It's important to consider SEO of a category page. Some of your customers will come from search engines and having a good-looking URL will help you rank higher.

Let's say we want to have a category page for TVs. It can be done by taking a general search page and applying a filter to only show TVs.

Now, if we do so on a search page, we'll have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/search?filters%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=categories&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=TVs
```

Not very readable!

What we want instead is to have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/category/tvs/
```

To achieve that, we'll need to:

1. Create the category page in our application;
1. Apply a filter via Search UI config.

The first part is highly dependent on your application's framework. Refer to its documentation for creating a new page.

For the second part, take the Search UI config you're using on the search page and add the `searchQuery.filters` value. Then pass the new config to your `SearchProvider`:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { config } from "./config";
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const categoryTvsConfig = {
  ...config,
  searchQuery: {
    ...config.searchQuery,
    // adding a filter to only show TVs
    filters: [{ field: "parent_category", values: ["TVs"] }]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPageTvs() {
  return (
    // Pass the new config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={categoryTvsConfig}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          // The components you want to render go here
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! Now the new category page will have a good URL and will only show the results that match the filter.

### Facets

<DocImage url="images/solutions-ecommerce/facets.png" size="l" alt="Facets" />

Facets is the most important part of the category page. Since category pages typically don't have their own search box, facets become the main tool to help users find the products they are looking for.

_Facets let users **explore** what's available in your store, rather then **search** for a specific product._

To help users find what they're looking for, it's best to provide a list of facets that are unique to the presented category.

In our example of TVs category page, in addition to common facets, like:

- Price
- Brand
- Rating

we also have TV-specific facets:

- Smart TV _(boolean)_
- TV resolution _(string: "Full HD", "4k", etc.)_
- TV diagonal _(number)_

These TV-specific facets are not useful on the search page, since they are not relevant to most of the results.

To implement this in Search UI, you'll need to make a copy of Search UI config and make several modifications:

1. Add new result fields to `searchQuery.resultFields`;
1. Add new facets to `searchQuery.facets`;
1. (optional) Add new disjunctiveFacets `searchQuery.disjunctiveFacets`.

Then, you'll need to add the `Facet` components to UI.

Here's how to do it all at once:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { config } from "./config";
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const categoryTvsConfig = {
  ...config,
  searchQuery: {
    ...config.searchQuery,
    filters: [{ field: "parent_category", values: ["TVs"] }],
    // 1. Adding new resilt fields, these will be used for the facets
    result_fields: {
      ...config.searchQuery.result_fields,
      tv_size: { raw: {} },
      tv_smart_tv: { raw: {} },
      tv_resolution: { raw: {} }
    },
    // 2. Adding the new facets
    facets: {
      ...config.searchQuery.facets,
      tv_size: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      },
      tv_smart_tv: {
        type: "value"
      },
      tv_resolution: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      }
    },
    // 3. Making some of newly added facets disjunctive
    disjunctiveFacets: [
      ...config.searchQuery.disjunctiveFacets,
      "tv_size",
      "tv_resolution"
    ]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPageTvs() {
  return (
    // Pass the new config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={categoryTvsConfig}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          return (
            // The components you want to render go here
            // For the sake of brevity, we're only showing the new facets
            <>
              <Facet field="tv_smart_tv" label="Smart TV" view={BooleanFacet} />
              <Facet field="tv_resolution" label="Resolution" />
              <Facet field="tv_size" label="Diagonal size" />
            </>
          );
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

Search UI offers several kinds of facets out-of-the-box:

- MultiCheckboxFacet
- BooleanFacet
- SingleLinksFacet

Here's an example of how to use them and the resulting UI:

```jsx
import { BooleanFacet, SingleLinksFacet } from "@elastic/react-search-ui-views";

<Facet
  field="tv_smart_tv"
  label="Smart TV"
  view={BooleanFacet}
/>
<Facet
  field="tv_resolution"
  label="Resolution"
  view={SingleLinksFacet}
/>
<Facet
  field="tv_size"
  label="Diagonal size"
  filterType="any" // accepts "all", "any" and "none"
  // Using the default view={MultiCheckboxFacet}
/>
```

/>

### Filters

Examples for ecommerce product listing page

- pricing range filter

### Variant Examples

https://baymard.com/blog/combine-variations-one-list-item

- products appearing multiple times, one for each variant
- collapse the products on the productId. Each product can contain one or more variants. display variants within the product
- pros vs cons of variants within app-search

### Sorting

<DocImage
  url="images/solutions-ecommerce/sorting.png"
  size="l"
  alt="Sorting component"
/>

Adding sorting is simple â€” just use our `<Sorting/>` component, like so:

```js
import { Sorting } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

<Sorting
  label={"Sort by"}
  sortOptions={[
    {
      name: "Relevance",
      value: []
    },
    {
      name: "Price: Low to High",
      value: [{ field: "price", direction: "asc" }]
    },
    {
      name: "Price: High to Low",
      value: [{ field: "price", direction: "desc" }]
    }
  ]}
/>;
```

A good starting point for sorting options is to have these three:

- Relevance / Featured / Best Match (usually the default option)
- Price: Low to High
- Price: High to Low

Also consider adding some of these if they are applicable to your data:

- Popularity
- User rating
- Distance (to user)
- Newest first

### Handling no results

Talk about when theres no results for the category listing. For example:

- the brand category is empty, recommend other brands to the user that is linked to the brand
- The sale has closed, recommend the category to the user that isn't on sale

```

```
