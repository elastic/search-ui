## FAQ üîÆ

### Is Search UI only for React?

Nope. Search UI is "headless".

You can write support for it into any JavaScript framework. You can even use vanilla JavaScript.

[Read about the search-ui package](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/master/packages/search-ui) for more information, or check out the [Vue.js Example](https://github.com/elastic/vue-search-ui-demo).

### Can I use my own styles?

You can!

Read the <DocLink id="guides-customizing-styles-and-html" text="Custom Styles and Layout Guide" /> to learn more, or check out the [Seattle Indies Expo Demo](https://github.com/elastic/seattle-indies-expo-search).

### Can I build my own Components?

Yes! Absolutely.

Check out the <DocLink id="guides-creating-your-own-components" text="Build Your Own Component Guide" />.

### Does Search UI only work with App Search?

Nope! We do have two first party connectors: Site Search and App Search.

But Search UI is headless. You can use _any_ Search API.
