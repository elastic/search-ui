## FAQ 🔮

### Is Search UI only for React?

Search UI is "headless". You can use vanilla JavaScript or write support for it into any JavaScript framework.

[Read about the search-ui package](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/packages/search-ui) for more information, or check out the [Vue.js Example](https://github.com/elastic/vue-search-ui-demo).

### Can I use my own styles?

You can!

### Can I build my own Components?

Yes! Absolutely.

### Does Search UI only work with App Search?

Nope! We do have two first party connectors: Site Search and App Search.

But Search UI is headless. You can use _any_ Search API.
