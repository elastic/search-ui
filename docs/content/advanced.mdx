The core is a separate, vanilla JS library which can be used for any JavaScript based implementation.

> [@elastic/search-ui](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/master/packages/search-ui)

The Headless Core implements the functionality behind a search experience, but without its own view. It provides the underlying "state" and "actions" associated with that view. For instance, the core provides a `setSearchTerm` action, which can be used to save a `searchTerm` property in the state. Calling `setSearchTerm` using the value of an `<input>` will save the `searchTerm` to be used to build a query.

All of the Components in this library use the Headless Core under the hood. For instance, Search UI provides a `SearchBox` Component for collecting input from a user. But you are not restricted to using just that Component. Since Search UI lets you work directly with "state" and "actions", you could use any type of input you want! As long as your input or Component calls the Headless Core's `setSearchTerm` action, it will "just work". This gives you maximum flexibility over your experience if you need more than the Components in Search UI have to offer.

The `SearchProvider` is a React wrapper around the Headless Core, and makes state and actions available to Search UI
and in a React [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), and also via a
[Render Prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

It looks like this:

```jsx
<SearchProvider config={config}>
  <WithSearch>
    {/*WithSearch exposes the "Context"*/}
    {(context) => {
      // Context contains state, like "searchTerm"
      const searchTerm = context.searchTerm;
      // Context also contains actions, like "setSearchTerm"
      const setSearchTerm = context.setSearchTerm;
      return (
        <div className="App">
          {/*An out-of-the-box Component like SearchBox uses State and Actions under the hood*/}
          <SearchBox />
          {/*We could work directly with those State and Actions also */}
          <input value={searchTerm} onChange={setSearchTerm} />
        </div>
      );
    }}
  </WithSearch>
</SearchProvider>
```

## Working with the Headless Core

If you wish to work with Search UI outside of a particular Component, you'll work
directly with the core.

There are two methods for accessing the headless core directly, `withSearch` and
`WithSearch`. They use the [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) and
[Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) patterns, respectively. The two methods
are similar, and choosing between the two is mostly personal preference.

Both methods expose a `mapContextToProps` function which allows you to pick which state and actions
from context you need to work with.

### mapContextToProps

`mapContextToProps` allows you to pick which state and actions
from Context you need to work with. `withSearch` and `WithSearch` both use [React.PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent),
and will only re-render when the picked state has changed.

| name    | type   | description         |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| context | Object | The current Context |
| props   | Object | The current props   |

ex.:

```jsx
// Selects `searchTerm` and `setSearchTerm` for use in Component
withSearch(({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm }) => ({
  searchTerm,
  setSearchTerm
}))(Component);

// Uses current `props` to conditionally modify context
withSearch(({ searchTerm }, { someProp }) => ({
  searchTerm: someProp ? "" : searchTerm
}))(Component);
```

### withSearch

This is the [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) approach to working with the
core.

This is typically used for creating your own Components.

See <DocLink id="advanced" section="build-your-own-component" text="Build Your Own Component" />.

### WithSearch

This is the [Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) approach to working with the core.

One use case for that would be to render a "loading" indicator any time the application is fetching data.

For example:

```jsx
<SearchProvider config={config}>
  <WithSearch mapContextToProps={({ isLoading }) => ({ isLoading })}>
    {({ isLoading }) => (
      <div className="App">
        {isLoading && <div>I'm loading now</div>}
        {!isLoading && (
          <Layout
            header={<SearchBox />}
            bodyContent={<Results titleField="title" urlField="nps_link" />}
          />
        )}
      </div>
    )}
  </WithSearch>
</SearchProvider>
```

### Combining Actions

There are certain cases where you may need to apply one or more actions at a time. Search UI intelligently
batches actions into a single API call.

For example, if you need to apply two filters at once, it is perfectly acceptable to write the following code:

```js
addFilter("states", "Alaska", "any");
addFilter("world_heritage_site", "true");
```

This will only result in a single API call.

## Headless Core Reference

### SearchProvider

The `SearchProvider` is a top-level Component which is essentially a wrapper around the core.

It exposes the <DocLink id="advanced" section="state" text="State" /> and <DocLink id="advanced" section="actions" text="Actions" /> of the core in a <DocLink id="advanced" section="context" text="Context" />.

Params:

| name     | type       | description                                                                                               |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| config   | Object     | See the <DocLink id="advanced" section="advanced-configuration" text="Advanced Configuration" /> section. |
| children | React Node |                                                                                                           |

### Context

The "Context" is a flattened object containing, as keys, all <DocLink id="advanced" section="state" text="State" /> and <DocLink id="advanced" section="actions" text="Actions" />.

We refer to it as "Context" because it is implemented with a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

ex.

```js
{
  resultsPerPage: 10, // Request State
  setResultsPerPage: () => {}, // Action
  current: 1, // Request State
  setCurrent: () => {}, // Action
  error: '', // Response State
  isLoading: false, // Response State
  totalResults: 1000, // Response State
  ...
}
```

### Actions

| method              | params                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | return | description                                                                                                                                                                      |

### State

State can be divided up into a few different types.

1. Request State - State that is used as parameters on Search API calls.
2. Result State - State that represents a response from a Search API call.
3. Application State - The general state.

Request State and Result State will often have similar values. For instance, `searchTerm` and `resultSearchTerm`.
`searchTerm` is the current search term in the UI, and `resultSearchTerm` is the term associated with the current
`results`. This can be relevant in the UI, where you might not want the search term on the page to change until AFTER
a response is received, so you'd use the `resultSearchTerm` state.

#### Request State

State that is used as parameters on Search API calls.

Request state can be set by:

- Using actions, like `setSearchTerm`
- The `initialState` option.
- The URL query string, if `trackUrlState` is enabled.

#### Response State

State that represents a response from a Search API call.

It is not directly update-able.

It is updated indirectly by invoking an action which results in a new API request.

| `wasSearched` | boolean | Has any query been performed since this driver was created? Can be useful for displaying initial states in the UI. |
