## View customization [api-react-components-results-view-customization]

A complete guide to view customization can be found in the [Customization: Component views and HTML](/reference/basic-usage.md#guides-customizing-styles-and-html-customizing-html) section.

This component accepts two view props: `view` and `resultView`. The `resultView` allows you to customize the individual result items that are displayed. The `view` prop allows you to customize that wrapper around those results, which by default is simply a `ul` element.

A separate guide specifically for customizing the Result component can be found [here.](/reference/api-react-components-result.md#api-react-components-result-view-customization), which can be used for providing a `resultView` prop.

The following properties are available in the view:

| Name      | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| className | Passed through from main component |
| children  |                                    |

See [Results.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/react-search-ui-views/src/Results.tsx) for an example.
