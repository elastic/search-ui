# Elasticsearch Connector [api-connectors-elasticsearch]

## ElasticsearchAPIConnector [api-connectors-elasticsearch-doc-reference]

::::{admonition} Security note
:class: important

This connector will talk to the **Elasticsearch** instance directly from the browser.  
We **strongly recommend** proxying requests through your backend using `ApiProxyConnector` to avoid exposing API credentials or allowing unrestricted access.

See [Using in Production](/reference/tutorials-elasticsearch-production-usage.md) for best practices.
::::

Search UI provides a way to connect to Elasticsearch directly without needing Enterprise Search. This is useful for when you dont need the features of Enterprise Search, such as relevance tuning.

The connector uses the same Search UI configuration that other connectors use.

You must specify either the cloud id or on-premise host url for the Elasticsearch connector.

```ts
import ElasticsearchAPIConnector from "@elastic/search-ui-elasticsearch-connector";
import type { IApiClientTransporter } from "@elastic/search-ui-elasticsearch-connector";

class CustomApiClientTransporter implements IApiClientTransporter {
  performRequest(searchRequest) {
    // Custom implementation
    return response;
  }
}

const customApiClient = new CustomApiClientTransporter();

const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // Either specify the cloud id or host or apiClient to connect to elasticsearch
  cloud: {
    id: "<elastic-cloud-id>" // cloud id found under your cloud deployment overview page
  },
  host: "http://localhost:9200", // host url for the Elasticsearch instance
  index: "<index-name>", // index name where the search documents are contained
  apiKey: "<api-key>", // Optional. apiKey used to authorize a connection to Elasticsearch instance.
  // This key will be visible to everyone so ensure its setup with restricted privileges.
  // See Authentication section for more details.
  connectionOptions: {
    // Optional connection options.
    headers: {
      "x-custom-header": "value" // Optional. Specify custom headers to send with the request
    }
  },
  // Optional. Custom API client implementation.
  // If not provided, a default ApiClientTransporter will be used.
  // This allows you to customize how requests are made to Elasticsearch.
  apiClient: customApiClient
});
```

### Request Lifecycle Hooks

The connector provides hooks to intercept and modify requests at different stages of the search lifecycle. Each hook has the following type signature:

```ts
type SearchQueryHook<T> = (
  params: {
    requestBody: SearchRequest;
    requestState: RequestState;
    queryConfig: T;
  },
  next: (newQueryOptions: SearchRequest) => Promise<ResponseBody>
) => Promise<ResponseBody>;
```

Where:

- `RequestState` contains the current search ui state ([RequestState](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/search-ui/src/types/index.ts#L51))
- `queryConfig` is either [QueryConfig](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/search-ui/src/types/index.ts#L188) for search requests or [AutocompleteQueryConfig](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/search-ui/src/types/index.ts#L136) for autocomplete requests
- `SearchRequest` is the Elasticsearch request body ([Search API Request](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html))
- `ResponseBody` is the Elasticsearch response ([Search API Response](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html))

The hooks can be configured in the connector config options:

```ts
const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // ... other config options ...
  interceptSearchRequest: async (
    { requestBody, requestState, queryConfig },
    next
  ) => {
    console.log("Search request:", requestBody);
    const response = await next(requestBody);
    console.log("Search response:", response);
    return response;
  },
  interceptAutocompleteResultsRequest: async (
    { requestBody, requestState, queryConfig },
    next
  ) => {
    console.log("Autocomplete results request:", requestBody);
    const response = await next(requestBody);
    console.log("Autocomplete results response:", response);
    return response;
  },
  interceptAutocompleteSuggestionsRequest: async (
    { requestBody, requestState, queryConfig },
    next
  ) => {
    console.log("Autocomplete suggestions request:", requestBody);
    const response = await next(requestBody);
    console.log("Autocomplete suggestions response:", response);
    return response;
  }
});
```

Each hook **must** call `next(requestBody)` with the request body and return its result. This is required because:

1. The `next` function is responsible for actually sending the request to Elasticsearch
2. Without calling `next`, the request will never reach Elasticsearch
3. The response from `next` contains the search results that need to be returned to the UI

You can modify the request body before passing it to `next`, but you must always call `next` and return its result.

These hooks can be used for:

- Request/response logging
- Injecting custom fields
- Dynamically modifying requests based on state
- A/B testing and fallbacks (e.g., KNN fallback)

### Custom Query Builder

You can completely customize the query generation using the `getQueryFn` hook. The hook is called only when there is a search query, so you don't need to handle empty search terms. The hook has the following type signature:

```ts
type GetQueryFn = (
  state: RequestState,
  queryConfig: QueryConfig
) => SearchRequest["query"];
```

Where:

- `RequestState` - [RequestState](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/search-ui/src/types/index.ts#L51) - search UI state
- `QueryConfig` - [QueryConfig](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/search-ui/src/types/index.ts#L191) - search configuration
- `SearchRequest["query"]` - [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) - query part of the Elasticsearch request body

Example usage:

::::{tab-set}
:group: query-examples

:::{tab-item} Semantic Search
:sync: semantic

```ts
const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // ... other config options ...
  getQueryFn: (state, config) => ({
    semantic: {
      field: "inference_field",
      query: state.searchTerm
    }
  })
});
```

:::

:::{tab-item} KNN Search
:sync: knn

```ts
const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // ... other config options ...
  getQueryFn: (state, config) => ({
    knn: {
      field: "embedding",
      query_vector: [
        /* embedding array */
      ],
      k: 10,
      num_candidates: 100
    }
  })
});
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Sparse Vector
:sync: sparse

```ts
const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // ... other config options ...
  getQueryFn: (state, config) => ({
    sparse_vector: {
      field: "description_semantic",
      inference_id: ".elser-2-elasticsearch",
      query: state.searchTerm
    }
  })
});
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Multi Match
:sync: multi-match

```ts
const connector = new ElasticsearchAPIConnector({
  // ... other config options ...
  getQueryFn: (state, config) => ({
    multi_match: {
      query: state.searchTerm,
      fields: ["title^3", "description"],
      type: "best_fields",
      fuzziness: "AUTO"
    }
  })
});
```

:::

::::

The `getQueryFn` allows you to:

- Override the default query generation logic
- Implement custom multi_match, match, term and other DSL queries
- Use semantic search, KNN and text_expansion queries for AI-powered search

::::{admonition} Note
:class: important

This hook only replaces the query part of the request body. Filters are still added separately and automatically mixed in.
::::

## ApiProxyConnector [api-connectors-elasticsearch-api-proxy-doc-reference]

The `ApiProxyConnector` is used when you want to proxy search requests through your own backend rather than exposing your Elasticsearch cluster directly to the browser.

It sends `onSearch` and `onAutocomplete` requests to your API, which is expected to forward them to Elasticsearch using `ElasticsearchAPIConnector`.

```js
import { ApiProxyConnector } from "@elastic/search-ui-elasticsearch-connector/api-proxy";
// Alternatively:
// import { ApiProxyConnector } from "@elastic/search-ui-elasticsearch-connector";

const connector = new ApiProxyConnector({
  basePath: "/api", // Base path for your proxy server
  fetchOptions: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer your-auth-token" // Optional fetch params
    }
  }
});
```

**Constructor Parameters**

| Argument     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| basePath     | string | **Optional.** The base URL path for your proxy server. _Default is "/api"._                                                                      |
| fetchOptions | object | **Optional.** Custom [RequestInit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit) options passed to fetch, e.g., headers or mode. |

**Expected Server API**

The server is expected to expose two endpoints:

- `POST /search` — handles search requests
- `POST /autocomplete` — handles autocomplete requests

Both endpoints should accept a body with the following format:

```json
{
  "state": {
    /* RequestState */
  },
  "queryConfig": {
    /* QueryConfig */
  }
}
```

And respond with the standard Search UI response types:

- `ResponseState` for `/search`
- `AutocompleteResponseState` for `/autocomplete`

For a full working example with server setup, see the Using in [Production guide](/reference/tutorials-elasticsearch-production-usage.md) or jump to the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/examples/sandbox?file=/src/pages/elasticsearch-production-ready/index.jsx).

#### Example Facet Configuration [api-connectors-elasticsearch-example-facet-configuration]

```js
{
  visitors: {
    type: "range",
    ranges: [
      { from: 0, to: 10000, name: "0 - 10000" },
      { from: 10001, to: 100000, name: "10001 - 100000" },
      { from: 100001, to: 500000, name: "100001 - 500000" },
      { from: 500001, to: 1000000, name: "500001 - 1000000" },
      { from: 1000001, to: 5000000, name: "1000001 - 5000000" },
      { from: 5000001, to: 10000000, name: "5000001 - 10000000" },
      { from: 10000001, name: "10000001+" }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### How to apply the filter [api-connectors-elasticsearch-how-to-apply-the-filter]

```js
setFilter("visitors", {
  name: "10001 - 100000", // name of the option
  from: 10001, // both from and to will be ignored
  to: 100000
});
```

#### Applying a range to a field that isn't a facet [api-connectors-elasticsearch-applying-a-range-to-a-field-that-isnt-a-facet]

If the field isn't a facet, you will be able to apply filters to the search using `value`, `numeric range` and `date range`, depending on the field type.

```js
setFilter("precio", {
  name: "precio",
  from: rangePrices[0],
  to: rangePrices[1]
});
```

### _None_ Filter Type [api-connectors-elasticsearch-none-filter-type]

You can use the `none` filter type to exclude documents that match certain values (works as a must_not filter in Elasticsearch).

#### Example

```js
searchQuery: {
  filters: [
    {
      type: "none", // Exclude documents where brand.keyword is "apple"
      field: "brand.keyword",
      values: ["apple"]
    }
  ];
}
```

This filter will exclude all documents where the field `brand.keyword` is equal to `"apple"`.

## Autocomplete [api-connectors-elasticsearch-autocomplete]

Search UI supports autocomplete functionality to suggest search terms that provide results. The autocomplete functionality is built on top of the Elasticsearch `suggest` and `bool prefix query` API.

To take advantage of the feature, first update the [autocomplete query](/reference/api-core-configuration.md#api-core-configuration-autocomplete-query) configuration.

Below is an example of what the `autocompleteQuery` may look like.

```js
autocompleteQuery: {
  // performs a prefix search on the query
  results: {
    resultsPerPage: 5, // number of results to display. Default is 5.
    search_fields: {
      // the fields to prefix search on
      title_suggest: {}
    },
    result_fields: {
      // Add snippet highlighting within autocomplete suggestions
      title: { snippet: { size: 100, fallback: true }},
      nps_link: { raw: {} }
    }
  },
  // performs a query to suggest for values that partially match the incomplete query
  suggestions: {
    types: {
      // Limit query to only suggest based on "title" field
      documents: {  fields: ["title_completion"] }
    },
    // Limit the number of suggestions returned from the server
    size: 4
  }
}
```

Above we are configuring both the `results` and `suggestions` sections of the autocomplete query.

`results` will need a search field to perform a prefix search on the query. We advise using a `search_as_you_type` field to be used. `suggestions` require a `completion` type field to perform a query to suggest for values that partially match the incomplete query.

Below is an example of the mappings for the above example. `title_suggest` is a `search_as_you_type` field and `title_completion` is a `completion` type field.

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title_suggest": {
        "type": "search_as_you_type"
      },
      "title_completion": {
        "type": "completion"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With a combination of this configuration + the [Searchbox](/reference/api-react-components-search-box.md) component with autocomplete configuration, your users will be able to see suggestions as they type within the search box.

## Fuzziness [api-connectors-elasticsearch-fuzziness]

The Elasticsearch Connector supports typo tolerance through Elasticsearch's `fuzziness` setting. This is enabled by setting `fuzziness: true` in the `searchQuery` configuration (or in `autocomplete` query configurations that follow the same structure).

When enabled, `fuzziness: true` is internally translated to `fuzziness: "AUTO"` in Elasticsearch `multi_match` queries. The `AUTO` mode automatically adjusts the allowed edit distance based on the length of the search term, enabling effective fuzzy matching for both short and long inputs.

For more details, refer to the [Elasticsearch Fuzzy Query documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-fuzzy-query.html).
