# Using with Vue.js [guides-using-with-vue-js]

While Search UI doesn’t have a component library for Vue.js, you can still use them together, just with a little extra work.

To achieve that you’ll need to import and work directly with Search UI Core API. Read a short [API reference](/reference/api-reference.md) guide for high-level overview on the approach.

Once you’re familiar with the concept of Search UI core, the following docs will give you deeper dive into available APIs:

- [Core API](/reference/api-core-configuration.md)
- [State](/reference/api-core-state.md)
- [Actions](/reference/api-core-actions.md)

## Example [guides-using-with-vue-js-example]

The following demo is a good starting point for your Search UI implementation. The source code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/examples/vue](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/examples/vue)

:::{tip}
Check out our Vue.js integration demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/examples/vue).

The example demonstrates how to implement Search UI in a Vue.js application.
