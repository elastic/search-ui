# Product Detail Page [solutions-ecommerce-product-detail-page]

You can put many things on a product detail page: image, description, specs. They are all describing the product itself.

But a critical piece that often gets overlooked is cross-sell recommendations.

These are the lists of products located under the product description. They often come under such headings:

- People who viewed this item also viewed
- Often bought together
- You might also like
- etc.

Cross-sell recommendations help users find the right product if the current one does not satisfy their criteria or find the related products faster (for example, frying pan + lid).

Technically, cross-sell recommendations are usually implemented as product carousels. To build one, check out our [Product carousel guide](/reference/solutions-ecommerce-carousel.md), which has an implementation example.
