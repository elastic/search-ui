# Search UI

Search UI is a JavaScript library for building modern, customizable search experiences using Elastic as a backend. Maintained by the Elastic team, it helps you implement search interfaces with minimal boilerplate.

As a headless library, Search UI separates logic from presentation. It provides search state and actions you can use with React, vanilla JavaScript, or other frameworks like Vue.
