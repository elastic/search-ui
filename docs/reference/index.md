## FAQ üîÆ [overview-faq]


### Is Search UI only for React? [overview-is-search-ui-only-for-react]

Search UI is "headless". You can use vanilla JavaScript or write support for it into any JavaScript framework.

[Read about the search-ui package](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/packages/search-ui) for more information, or check out the [Vue.js Example](https://github.com/elastic/vue-search-ui-demo).


### Can I use my own styles? [overview-can-i-use-my-own-styles]

You can!

Read the [Custom Styles and Layout Guide](/reference/basic-usage.md) to learn more, or check out the [Seattle Indies Expo Demo](https://github.com/elastic/seattle-indies-expo-search).


### Can I build my own Components? [overview-can-i-build-my-own-components]

Yes! Absolutely.

Check out the [Build Your Own Component Guide](/reference/guides-creating-own-components.md).


### Does Search UI only work with App Search? [overview-does-search-ui-only-work-with-app-search]

Nope! We do have two first party connectors: Site Search and App Search.

But Search UI is headless. You can use *any* Search API.

Read the [Building a custom connector](/reference/guides-building-custom-connector.md) to learn more about building your own connector for your API.
