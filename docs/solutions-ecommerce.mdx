In ecommerce, to build great search experiences for your customers, you need to focus on these major experiences:

- **Global Search bar**: to give customers the ability to perform a search on any page of your store.
- **Search Page**: to give your customers a place to see results relevant to their query and refine them using facets.
- **Category Page**: to show a list of products from a particular category to help users explore available products.
- **Product Carousel**: to show a list of products within pages like the Homepage or Checkout, or if a query returns no results.
- **Product Detail Page**: to describe the product and provide cross-sell recommendations, like similar products from the same category or "frequently bought with" items.
