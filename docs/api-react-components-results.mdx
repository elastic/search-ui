### Configuring search queries

Certain aspects of search results can be configured in `SearchProvider`, using the `searchQuery` configuration, such as
term highlighting and search fields. See the <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/core/configuration"

  text="Search Query Configuration"
/> guide
for more information.

### View customization

A complete guide to view customization can be found in the <DocLink slug="/search-ui/guides/customizing-styles-and-html" section="customizing-html" text="Customization: Component views and HTML" /> section.

This component accepts two view props: `view` and `resultView`. The `resultView` allows you to customize the individual result items that are displayed. The `view` prop allows you to customize that wrapper around those results, which by default is simply a `ul` element.

A separate guide specifically for customizing the Result component can be found <DocLink slug="/search-ui/api/react/components/result" section="view-customization" text="here." />, which can be used for providing a `resultView` prop.

The following properties are available in the view:

| Name      | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| className | Passed through from main component |
| children  |                                    |

See [Results.tsx](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/blob/main/packages/react-search-ui-views/src/Results.tsx) for an example.
