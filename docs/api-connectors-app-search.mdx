## Usage

```shell
npm install --save @elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector
```

```js
import AppSearchAPIConnector from "@elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector";

const connector = new AppSearchAPIConnector({
  searchKey: "search-371auk61r2bwqtdzocdgutmg",
  engineName: "search-ui-examples",
  endpointBase: "http://127.0.0.1:3002"
});
```

### Additional options

const connector = new AppSearchAPIConnector({
