The `SearchProvider` is a React wrapper around the Headless Core, and makes state and actions available to Search UI
and in a React [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), and also via a
[Render Prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

It looks like this:

```jsx
import { SearchProvider, SearchBox } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";
import AppSearchAPIConnector from "@elastic/search-ui-app-search-connector";

const connector = new AppSearchAPIConnector({
  searchKey: "search-371auk61r2bwqtdzocdgutmg",
  engineName: "search-ui-examples",
  endpointBase: "http://my-app-search-host:3002"
});

const configurationOptions = {
  apiConnector: connector,
  searchQuery: { ... },
  autocompleteQuery: { ... },
  hasA11yNotifications: true,
  a11yNotificationMessages: {
    searchResults: ({ start, end, totalResults, searchTerm }) =>
      `Searching for "${searchTerm}". Showing ${start} to ${end} results out of ${totalResults}.`
  },
  alwaysSearchOnInitialLoad: true
};

const App = () => (
  <SearchProvider config={configurationOptions}>
    <div className="App">
      <SearchBox />
    </div>
  </SearchProvider>
);
```

### Context

The "Context" is a flattened object containing, as keys, all <DocLink id="api-state" text="State" /> and <DocLink id="api-actions" text="Actions" />.

We refer to it as "Context" because it is implemented with a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

ex.

```js
{
  resultsPerPage: 10, // Request State
  setResultsPerPage: () => {}, // Action
  current: 1, // Request State
  setCurrent: () => {}, // Action
  error: '', // Response State
  isLoading: false, // Response State
  totalResults: 1000, // Response State
  ...
}
```

### Initial State

This is useful for defaulting a search term, sort, etc.

Example

```js
  initialState: { searchTerm: "test", resultsPerPage: 40 }
```

See <DocLink id="api-state" section="RequestState" text="Request State" /> for more properties that can be set in initial state.
