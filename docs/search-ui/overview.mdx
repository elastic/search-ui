A [React](https://reactjs.org) library that allows you to quickly implement search experiences without re-inventing the wheel.

Use it with [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) to have a search experience up and running in minutes.

### Features üëç

- **You know, for search** - Maintained by [Elastic](https://elastic.co), the team behind Elasticsearch.
- **Speedy Implementation** - Build a complete search experience with a few lines of code.
- **Customizable** - Tune the components, markup, styles, and behaviors to your liking.
- **Smart URLs** - Searches, paging, filtering, and more, are captured in the URL for direct result linking.
- **Flexible front-end** - Not just for React. Use with any JavaScript library, even vanilla JavaScript.
- **Flexible back-end** - Use it with Elasticsearch, Elastic Enterprise Search, or any other search API.

## FAQ üîÆ

### Where can I learn more?

The <DocLink id="advanced" text="Advanced guide" /> contains several useful guides. üòé

### Is Search UI only for React?

Nope. Search UI is "headless".

You can write support for it into any JavaScript framework. You can even use vanilla JavaScript.

[Read about the search-ui package](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/master/packages/search-ui) for more information, or check out the [Vue.js Example](https://github.com/elastic/vue-search-ui-demo).

### Can I use my own styles?

You can!

Read the <DocLink id="advanced" section="custom-styles-and-layout" text="Custom Styles and Layout Guide" /> to learn more, or check out the [Seattle Indies Expo Demo](https://github.com/elastic/seattle-indies-expo-search).

### Can I build my own Components?

Yes! Absolutely.

Check out the <DocLink id="advanced" section="build-your-own-component" text="Build Your Own Component Guide" />.

### Does Search UI only work with App Search?

Nope! We do have two first party connectors: Site Search and App Search.

But Search UI is headless. You can use _any_ Search API.

Read the <DocLink id="advanced" section="connectors-and-handlers" text="Connectors and Handlers Guide" />.

### How do I use this with Elasticsearch?

First off, we should mention that it is not recommended to make API calls directly to Elasticsearch
from a browser, as noted in the [elasticsearch-js client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js#browser).

The safest way to interact with Elasticsearch from a browser is to make all Elasticsearch queries server-side. Or you can use [Elastic App Search](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/app-search-service?ultron=searchui-repo&blade=readme&hulk=product), which can create public, scoped API credentials and be exposed directly to a browser.

That being said, Search UI will still work with Elasticsearch (or any other API, for that matter). Read the
<DocLink id="advanced" section="connectors-and-handlers" text="Connectors and Handlers Guide" /> to learn more, or check out the
[Elasticsearch Example](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/master/examples/elasticsearch).

### Where do I report issues with the Search UI?

If something is not working as expected, please open an [issue](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/issues/new).

### Where can I go to get help?

The Enterprise Search team at Elastic maintains this library and are happy to help. Try posting your question to the [Elastic Enterprise Search](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/enterprise-search/84) discuss forums. Be sure to mention that you're using search-ui and also let us know what backend your using; whether it's App Search, Site Search, Elasticsearch, or something else entirely.
