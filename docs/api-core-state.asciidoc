// :keywords: state

State can be divided up into a few different types.

. <<api-core-state-request-state,Request State>> - State that is used
as parameters on Search API calls.
. <<api-core-state-response-state,Response State>> - State that represents a response from a Search API call.
. <<api-core-state-application-state,Application State>> - The general state.

Request State and Response State will often have similar values. For instance, `searchTerm` and `resultSearchTerm`.
`searchTerm` is the current search term in the UI, and `resultSearchTerm` is the term associated with the current
`results`. This can be relevant in the UI, where you might not want the search term on the page to change until AFTER
a response is received, so you'd use the `resultSearchTerm` state.

== Request State

State that is used as parameters on Search API calls.

Request state can be set by:

* The `initialState` option.
* The URL query string, if `trackUrlState` is enabled.

[[api-core-state-response-state]]
== Response State

State that represents a response from a Search API call.

It is not directly update-able.

It is updated indirectly by invoking an action which results in a new API request.

|===
| field| description

| `autocompletedResults`
| An array of results items fetched for an autocomplete dropdown.

| `autocompletedResultsRequestId`
| A unique ID for the current autocompleted search results.

| `autocompletedSuggestions`
| A keyed object of query suggestions. It's keyed by type since multiple types of query suggestions can be set here.

| `autocompletedSuggestionsRequestId`
| A unique ID for the current autocompleted suggestion results.

| `facets`
| Will be populated if `facets` configured in <<api-core-configuration-facets,Search Query Facets Configuration>>.

| `rawResponse`
| The response object received from the API

| `requestId`
| A unique ID for the current search results.

| `results`
| An array of result items.

| `resultSearchTerm`
| As opposed the the `searchTerm` state, which is tied to the current search parameter, this is tied to the searchTerm for the current results. There will be a period of time in between when a request is started and finishes where the two pieces of state will differ.

| `totalResults`
| Total number of results found for the current query.

[[api-core-state-application-state]]
== Application State

|===
| field| description

| `error`
| Error message, if an error was thrown.

| `isLoading`
| Whether or not a search is currently being performed.

| `wasSearched`
| Has any query been performed since this driver was created? Can be useful for displaying initial states in the UI.
