## Result

Displays a search result.

### Example

```jsx

import { Result } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

...

<SearchProvider config={config}>
  {({ results }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {results.map(result => (
          <Result key={result.id.raw}
            result={result}
            titleField="title"
            urlField="nps_link"
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }}
</SearchProvider>
```

### Configuring search queries

Certain aspects of search results can be configured in `SearchProvider`, using the `searchQuery` configuration, such as
term highlighting and search fields. See the <DocLink
  id="api-core-configuration"
  section="search-query-queryconfig"
  text="Search Query Configuration"
/> guide
for more information.

Example: See packages/react-search-ui-views/src/Result.tsx for an example.

#### Other guidance

The `SearchResult` type will contain both `raw` and `snippet` values.

`snippet` values will contain html snippets and are sanitized for XSS, and hence are considered safe for use with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

`raw` values are _not_ processed are are hence considered _not_ safe for use with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized properly first.
