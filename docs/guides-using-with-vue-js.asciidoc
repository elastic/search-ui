While Search UI doesn't have a component library for Vue.js, you can still use them together, just with a little extra work.

To achieve that you'll need to import and work directly with Search UI Core API. Read a short <<api-architecture>> guide for high-level overview on the approach.

Once you're familiar with the concept of Search UI core, the following docs will give you deeper dive into available APIs:

* <<api-core-configuration>>
* <<api-core-state>>
* <<api-core-actions>>
