This Connector is used to connect Search UI to Elastic's [Site Search](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/site-search-service) API.

While Site Search supports multiple document types, Search UI will only
support a single document type, and it must be provided up front when
creating the connector.

Note that Site Search does not support certain features of Search UI:

- `disjunctiveFacets` or `disjunctiveFacetsAnalyticsTags` configuration options
- Only `value` facets are allowed, no `range` facet support.
- `sort` option is not supported on facets.
- `size` option is not supported on facets.
- Does not support multiple filters applied to a single field.
- Cannot apply more than 1 range filter on a single field.
- Analytics tags are not supported in `click`.
- `suggestions` are not supported in autocomplete, only `results`
- The `none` filter type is not supported.

## Usage

```shell
npm install --save @elastic/search-ui-site-search-connector
